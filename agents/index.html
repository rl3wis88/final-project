    <h1>Upcoming Free Agents</h1>
    <img src="../img/blount.jpg" width="500px" alt="Not under contract!">
    <h2>All Current Eagles not under contract for 2018:</h2>
    <h3 class="a-h-3">LeGarette Blount</h3>
    <p>His inclusion on this list isn't so much about Blount being some high-priced target as much as it is the Eagles potentially reshaping their backfield without him, but if he's willing to stay on another low-risk, one-year deal, who's to say Philadelphia won't have him back? Don't rule out a situation similar to last offseason, when Blount hit free agency and only latched onto a prospective contender closer to the summer.</p>
    <h3 class="a-h-3">Nigel Bradham</h3>
    <p>He has to be the biggest potential prize of the Eagles' free-agent crop, by far. It's a mild surprise, in fact, that Philadelphia hasn't already extended the Jim Schwartz favorite, but there's obviously still time for that. A former Buffalo Bills starter who came over with Schwartz in 2016, the imposing first-teamer had stretches of Pro Bowl-caliber play this year, and ever since middle linebacker Jordan Hicks went down with a season-ending injury early in the season, Bradham has been lauded for his direction at the heart of the defense, playing a big role in the team's reputed run defense.</p>
    <h3 class="a-h-3">Patrick Robinson</h3>
    <p>Once a promising youngster with the New Orleans Saints, he bounced around, on and off the injury report, before landing in Philly as a trial-run nickel corner. Under Schwartz, however, Robinson has been tremendously steady, sometimes earning the reputation of top CB in the Eagles' secondary. At 30, he's not a sure bet to be back, especially with early-round picks Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas in the waiting, but if Philadelphia doesn't at least extend another short-term offer, that'd be a surprise.</p>
    <h3 class="a-h-3">Darren Sproles</h3>
    <p>The longtime utility man is no spring chicken at age 34, and everyone's going to be cautious with him coming off both a torn ACL and broken arm, but Sproles is also just a year removed from going to his third straight Pro Bowl. If he decides he's coming back, which seems more than likely at this point, the Eagles are going to have a tough decision to make</p>
    <h3 class="a-h-3">Trey Burton</h3>
    <p>There's no doubt that Zach Ertz is locked up for the long haul as the No. 1 in town, but with Brent Celek potentially playing his last game as an Eagle on Sunday, there should be room for Burton in Philadelphia. That doesn't mean, however, the two sides are guaranteed for a reunion. Burton loves his teammates, but maybe we're in for a testing-of-the-market situation.</p>
